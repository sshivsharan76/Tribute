        <p>
            Not only is he a captain of the most cricket-obsessed country in the world, he is also a key batsman and a wicket keeper â€“ the latter being an exteremly physical and energy-draining job. According to Impactindex, MS Dhoni is India's most high impact ODI cricket player, followed by Kapil Dev and Sachin Tendulkar.

     <li>  <h2>How did MS Dhoni become famous?</h2></li>
        <p>Dhoni made his international debut in 2004. His talent with the bat came to the fore in an innings of 148 runs against Pakistan in his fifth international match. Within a year he joined the India Test team, where he quickly established himself with a century (100 or more runs in a single innings) against Pakistan.

            <li> <h2>Why Dhoni is a good leader?</h2></li> 
        <p>A leader is as much as part of the team as the rest of the members. Dhoni always supported his players at all times with trust and confidence and stood up for them when needed. The confidence that he created among his fellow team members helped them deliver their best.</p>
